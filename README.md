## EXIF Metadata Indexer

Please view the source in `src/main/java/tylerbenson/MetadataLoader.java`.

If you load the gradle project in an IDE it should launch as a main method.

If I had more time, then refactoring to break out the service responsibilities would be a high priority, second would be testing.
